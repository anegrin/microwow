With this MIDlet you can power on your computer remotely. It has multiple profiles; on each profile you can specify:

  * a host name (IP or DNS name)
  * a port
  * the MAC address of the computer to power ON
  * how many times to send the WOL Magic Packet (for busy networks)
  * an optional password

It's multilanguage (get from system - TODO configurable):

  * English
  * Italian

If you find some tutorial for your specific router please let me know commenting or opening a new issue. Thank you.
